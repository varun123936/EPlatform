E-commerce Platform project complete example end to end using node js

npm install express mongoose bcryptjs jsonwebtoken body-parser dotenv

Logging
npm install winston

transports.Console(): Logs to the console, useful during development.
transports.File({ filename: 'logs/error.log', level: 'error' }): Logs errors to a file.
transports.File({ filename: 'logs/combined.log' }): Logs all messages to a combined log file.

Summary
By adding error handling and logging, the e-commerce platform is now more robust and maintainable:

Error Handling Middleware: Centralizes error management, making it easier to handle errors consistently across the application.
Logging with Winston: Provides detailed logs for both application behavior and errors, which are essential for debugging and monitoring.
HTTP Request Logging with Morgan: Captures every incoming HTTP request, giving insights into how the API is being used and identifying potential issues.
With these improvements, you now have a more production-ready e-commerce platform.

Update server.js:

javascript
Copy code
const morgan = require('morgan');
const logger = require('./utils/logger');

// HTTP request logging
app.use(morgan('combined', { stream: { write: message => logger.info(message.trim()) } }));
